Algorithm assigns\\nincoming points (immediately and irrevocably) to the chains which constitute a\\nchain partition of the order. The value of the game for orders of width $w$ is\\na minimum number $\\\\fVal(w)$ such that Algorithm has a strategy using at most\\n$\\\\fVal(w)$ chains on orders of width at most $w$. We analyze the chain\\npartition game for up-growing semi-orders. Surprisingly, the golden ratio comes\\ninto play and the value of the game is $\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\\\; w\\n\\\\rfloor$.\\n',\n 'Iterative Rounding for the Closest String Problem   The closest string problem is an NP-hard problem, whose task is to find a\\nstring that minimizes maximum Hamming distance to a given set of strings. This\\ncan be reduced to an integer program (IP). However, to date, there exists no\\nknown polynomial-time algorithm for IP. In 2004, Meneses et al. introduced a\\nbranch-and-bound (B & B) method for solving the IP problem. Their algorithm is\\nnot always efficient and has the exponential time complexity. In the paper, we\\nattempt to solve efficiently the IP problem by a greedy iterative rounding\\ntechnique. The proposed algorithm is polynomial time and much faster than the\\nexisting B & B IP for the CSP. If the number of strings is limited to 3, the\\nalgorithm is provably at most 1 away from the optimum. The empirical results\\nshow that in many cases we can find an exact solution. Even though we fail to\\nfind an exact solution, the solution found is very close to exact solution.\\n',\n 'Recognizing Partial Cubes in Quadratic Time   We show how to test whether a graph with n
