The sentence encoding part is similar to all other notebooks, but we don't use FAISS here. We first fetch top k passages from our dataset for the query, with k being a number >= 100. Then we use Cross-Encoder to rank the top k responses.\n\nCross encoder are computationally intensive as each corpus vector needs to be scored against the query vector for similarity. Hence, the entire dataset can't be searched just with cross encoder. Sentence transformers help us get the vector embeddings and determine the similarity using cosine metric (which is faster). The top 100 results can then be fed through cross-encoder to re-rank the results more accurately.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install

This\\ncan be reduced to an integer program (IP). However, to date, there exists no\\nknown polynomial-time algorithm for IP. In 2004, Meneses et al. introduced a\\nbranch-and-bound (B & B) method for solving the IP problem. Their algorithm is\\nnot always efficient and has the exponential time complexity. In the paper, we\\nattempt to solve efficiently the IP problem by a greedy iterative rounding\\ntechnique. The proposed algorithm is polynomial time and much faster than the\\nexisting B & B IP for the CSP. If the number of strings is limited to 3, the\\nalgorithm is provably at most 1 away from the optimum. The empirical results\\nshow that in many cases we can find an exact solution. Even though we fail to\\nfind an exact solution, the solution found is very close to exact solution.\\n',\n 'Recognizing Partial Cubes in Quadratic Time   We show how to test whether a graph with n

Extraction and normalization of\ntemporal expressions in Turkish has not been given attention so far except the\nextraction of some date and time expressions within the course of named entity\nrecognition. As TimeML is the current standard of temporal expression and event\nannotation in natural language texts, in this paper, we present an analysis of\ntemporal expressions in Turkish based on the related TimeML classification\n(i.e., date, time, duration, and set expressions). We have created a lexicon\nfor Turkish temporal expressions and devised considerably wide-coverage\npatterns using the lexical classes as the building blocks. We believe that the\nproposed patterns, together with convenient normalization rules, can be readily\nused by prospective temporal expression extraction tools for Turkish.\n\n\nTitle -  On TimeML-Compliant Temporal Expression Extraction in Turkish\nHit 2 before ranking - \n\nScore -  0.6514966487884521\n\nAbstract -    Automatic extraction of temporal information in text is an important\ncomponent of natural language understanding. It involves two basic tasks: (1)\nUnderstanding time expressions that are mentioned explicitly in text (e.g.,\nFebruary 27, 1998 or tomorrow), and (2) Understanding temporal information that\nis conveyed implicitly via relations. In this paper, we introduce CogCompTime,\na system that has these two important functionalities. It incorporates the most\nrecent progress, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is publicly\navailable.1 We believe that this demo will be useful for multiple time-aware\napplications and provide valuable insight for future research in temporal\nunderstanding.\n\n\nTitle -  CogCompTime: A Tool for Understanding Time in Natural Language Text\n\n\nHit 2 after ranking - \n\nCross encoder Score -  6.5255384\n\nAbstract -    Automatic annotation of temporal expressions is a research challenge of great\ninterest in the field of information extraction.

Many training procedures based on backpropagation use\ncross-entropy directly as their loss function. Instead, this theoretical essay\ninvestigates a dual process model with two processes, in which one process\nminimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence while its dual counterpart minimizes\nthe Shannon entropy. Postulating that learning consists of two dual processes\ncomplementing each other, the model defines an equilibrium state for both\nprocesses in which the loss function assumes its minimum. An advantage of the\nproposed model is that it allows deriving the optimal learning rate and\nmomentum weight to update network weights for backpropagation. Furthermore, the\nmodel introduces the golden ratio and complex numbers as important new concepts\nin machine learning.\n\n\nTitle -  A Dual Process Model for Optimizing Cross Entropy in Neural Networks\n\n\nHit 1 after ranking - \n\nCross encoder Score -  8.162387\n\nAbstract -    Cross-entropy loss is the standard metric used to train classification models\nin deep learning and gradient boosting. It is well-known that this loss\nfunction fails to account for similarities between the different values of the\ntarget. We propose a generalization of entropy called {\\em structured entropy}\nwhich uses a random partition to incorporate the structure of the target\nvariable in a manner which retains many theoretical properties of standard\nentropy. We show that a structured cross-entropy loss yields better results on\nseveral classification problems where the target variable has an a priori known\nstructure. The approach is simple, flexible, easily computable, and does not\nrely on a hierarchically defined notion of structure.\n\n\nTitle -  Loss Functions for Classification using Structured Entropy\nHit 2 before ranking - \n\nScore -  0.5693882703781128\n\nAbstract -    The R\\'{e}nyi cross-entropy measure between two distributions, a\ngeneralization of the Shannon cross-entropy, was recently used as a loss\nfunction for the improved design of deep learning generative adversarial\nnetworks. In this work, we examine the properties of this measure and derive\nclosed-form expressions for it when one of the distributions is fixed and when\nboth distributions belong to the exponential family. We also analytically\ndetermine a formula for the cross-entropy rate for stationary Gaussian\nprocesses and for finite-alphabet Markov sources.\n\n\nTitle -  On the R\\'{e}nyi Cross-Entropy\n\n\nHit 2 after ranking - \n\nCross encoder Score -  7.612485\n\nAbstract -    Cross-entropy is a widely used loss function in applications. It coincides\nwith the logistic loss applied to the outputs of a neural network, when the\nsoftmax is used. But, what guarantees can we rely on when using cross-entropy\nas a surrogate loss? We present a theoretical analysis of a broad family of\nlosses, comp-sum losses, that includes cross-entropy (or logistic loss),\ngeneralized cross-entropy, the mean absolute error and other loss\ncross-entropy-like functions. We give the first $H$-consistency bounds for\nthese loss functions. These are non-asymptotic guarantees that upper bound the\nzero-one loss estimation error in terms of the estimation error of a surrogate\nloss, for the specific hypothesis set $H$ used. We further show that our bounds\nare tight. These bounds depend on quantities called minimizability gaps, which\nonly depend on the loss function and the hypothesis set. To make them more\nexplicit, we give a specific analysis of these gaps for comp-sum losses. We\nalso introduce a new family of loss functions, smooth adversarial comp-sum\nlosses, derived from their comp-sum counterparts by adding in a related smooth\nterm. We show that these loss functions are beneficial in the adversarial\nsetting by proving that they admit $H$-consistency bounds. This leads to new\nadversarial robustness algorithms that consist of minimizing a regularized\nsmooth adversarial comp-sum loss. While our main purpose is a theoretical\nanalysis, we also present an extensive empirical analysis comparing comp-sum\nlosses. We further report the results of a series of experiments demonstrating\nthat our adversarial robustness algorithms outperform the current\nstate-of-the-art, while also achieving a superior non-adversarial accuracy.\n\n\nTitle -  Cross-Entropy Loss Functions: Theoretical Analysis and Applications\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For the first query, both the resonses are fair even before and after ranking, we do get much better and relevant responses after reranking for the second query.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"get_top_hits('rebalancing in kafka')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-22T18:30:50.076242Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-22T18:30:50.077247Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-22T18:30:50.429105Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-22T18:30:50.077183Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-22T18:30:50.428098Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"79a12438829e45a3bf93f15ffd48f6ba"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/4 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"edeed67dcf924e06b2503d9c61f189d2"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"Hit 1 before ranking - \n\nScore -  0.5709049701690674\n\nAbstract -    Apache Kafka addresses the general problem of delivering extreme high volume\nevent data to diverse consumers via a publish-subscribe messaging system.
