The region of phase space is\\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\\nselection of events.\\n',\n  'versions': [{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Mon, 2 Apr 2007 19:18:42 GMT'},\n   {'version': 'v2', 'created': 'Tue, 24 Jul 2007 20:10:27 GMT'}],\n  'update_date': '2008-11-26',\n  'authors_parsed': [['Balázs', 'C.', ''],\n   ['Berger', 'E.

Extraction and normalization of\\ntemporal expressions in Turkish has not been given attention so far except the\\nextraction of some date and time expressions within the course of named entity\\nrecognition. As TimeML is the current standard of temporal expression and event\\nannotation in natural language texts, in this paper, we present an analysis of\\ntemporal expressions in Turkish based on the related TimeML classification\\n(i.e., date, time, duration, and set expressions). We have created a lexicon\\nfor Turkish temporal expressions and devised considerably wide-coverage\\npatterns using the lexical classes as the building blocks. We believe that the\\nproposed patterns, together with convenient normalization rules, can be readily\\nused by prospective temporal expression extraction tools for Turkish.\\n',\n '  Structured information resulting from temporal information processing is\\ncrucial for a variety of natural language processing tasks, for instance to\\ngenerate timeline summarization of events from news documents, or to answer\\ntemporal/causal-related questions about some events. In this thesis we present\\na framework for an integrated temporal and causal relation extraction system.\\nWe first develop a robust extraction component for each type of relations, i.e.\\ntemporal order and causality. We then combine the two extraction components\\ninto an integrated relation extraction system, CATENA---CAusal and Temporal\\nrelation Extraction from NAtural language texts---, by utilizing the\\npresumption about event precedence in causality, that causing events must\\nhappened BEFORE resulting events. Several resources and techniques to improve\\nour relation extraction systems are also discussed, including word embeddings\\nand training data expansion. Finally, we report our adaptation efforts of\\ntemporal information processing for languages other than English, namely\\nItalian and Indonesian.\\n',\n '  Automatic annotation of temporal expressions is a research challenge of great\\ninterest in the field of information extraction. In this report, I describe a\\nnovel rule-based architecture, built on top of a pre-existing system, which is\\nable to normalise temporal expressions detected in English texts. Gold standard\\ntemporally-annotated resources are limited in size and this makes research\\ndifficult. The proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems with\\nrespect to TempEval-2 Shared Task (value attribute) and achieves substantially\\nbetter results with respect to the pre-existing system on top of which it has\\nbeen developed. I will also introduce a new free corpus consisting of 2822\\nunique annotated temporal expressions. Both the corpus and the system are\\nfreely available on-line.\\n',\n '  Automatic temporal ordering of events described in discourse has been of\\ngreat interest in recent years. Event orderings are conveyed in text via va\\nrious linguistic mechanisms including the use of expressions such as \"before\",\\n\"after\" or \"during\" that explicitly assert a temporal relation -- temporal\\nsignals. In this paper, we investigate the role of temporal signals in temporal\\nrelation extraction and provide a quantitative analysis of these expres sions\\nin the TimeBank annotated corpus.\\n',\n '  Automatic extraction of temporal relations between event pairs is an\\nimportant task for several natural language processing applications such as\\nQuestion Answering, Information Extraction, and Summarization. Since most\\nexisting methods are supervised and require large corpora, which for many\\nlanguages do not exist, we have concentrated our efforts to reduce the need for\\nannotated data as much as possible. This paper presents two different\\nalgorithms towards this goal. The first algorithm is a weakly supervised\\nmachine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between\\nevents. In the first stage, the algorithm learns a general classifier from an\\nannotated corpus. Then, inspired by the hypothesis of \"one type of temporal\\nrelation per discourse, it extracts useful information from a cluster of\\ntopically related documents. We show that by combining the global information\\nof such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier, a bootstrapping\\ncross-document classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between\\nevents. Our experiments show that without any additional annotated data, the\\naccuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous\\nsuccessful systems. The second proposed method for temporal relation extraction\\nis based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Within EM, we used\\ndifferent techniques such as a greedy best-first search and integer linear\\nprogramming for temporal inconsistency removal. We think that the experimental\\nresults of our EM based algorithm, as a first step toward a fully unsupervised\\ntemporal relation extraction method, is encouraging.\\n']"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
